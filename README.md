# SLNN for Pattern Recognition

> Singular Layer Neuronal Network for recognition of blurred digits sequences.

The aim of this project is to develop an application, based on unconstrained optimization algorithms, that allow to recognize the numbers in a sequence of blurred digits.

The procedure to achieve that goal will be to formulate a Single Layer
Neural Network that is going to be trained to recognize the different
numbers with First Derivative Optimization methods.
